# tran_htable

I have included the files I modified to make this thing work.
Place these files in: [rstm path]/bench/
  
1. Tran_NB_Hashtable.hpp

2. main.cpp


Take the "_c++11" out of filename for the corresponding files.
These should go right in the root rsmt directory. 
*Those files should work as expected by removing the suffix appended to them
but... if they dont i'll send the actual code I used to make the c++11 stuff work.
